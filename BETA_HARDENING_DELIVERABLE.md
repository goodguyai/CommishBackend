- Sentence-level scoring with query term matching
- Context inclusion (surrounding sentences)
- Smart passage truncation (max 300 chars per passage)
- Multiple passage support (up to 2 per rule)
- Term filter: ≥2 characters to capture fantasy abbreviations (QB, TE, IR)

**API Enhancement:**
```typescript
POST /api/rag/search/:leagueId
{
  "query": "What is the waiver priority system?",
  "limit": 5,        // Top-k results
  "threshold": 0.7,  // Confidence threshold
  "includePassages": true  // Extract relevant passages
}

Response:
{
  "results": [
    {
      "ruleId": "uuid",
      "content": "Full rule text...",
      "similarity": 0.85,
      "passages": [
        "Most relevant sentence about waiver priority...",
        "Additional context sentence..."
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Algorithm:**
1. Extract meaningful query terms (≥2 chars, exclude stopwords)
2. Perform vector similarity search (pgvector)
3. For each result, score sentences by query term matches
4. Extract top-scoring sentences with context
5. Truncate passages to 300 chars with smart boundaries
6. Fallback to beginning of rule if no matches

5. ✅ `GET /api/leagues` - Requires accountId (security working)

**Database Verification:**
```sql
-- Table existence
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';
Result: 14 tables ✅

-- Schema verification
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'leagues';
Result: All columns present including tone, feature_flags ✅

SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'polls';
Result: All columns present ✅

SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'owner_mappings';
Result: All columns present ✅

-- Data counts
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM leagues;        -- 0 (expected, no test data)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM polls;          -- 0 (expected)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM owner_mappings; -- 0 (expected)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM events;         -- 1 (error event logged during testing)
```
