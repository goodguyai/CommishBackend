Prime Directives (paste first)

§Prime Directives
1) Supabase is the ONLY database. Do not introduce Neon/Replit DB. Do not change schema by code — use SQL migrations only.
2) Keep APP_BASE_URL=https://thecommish.replit.app. Never switch to localhost routes in code or links.
3) API routes MUST return JSON; never serve HTML for /api/*.
4) Preserve existing Discord security: raw body + signature verification for /api/discord/interactions.
5) Read env ONLY via server/services/env.ts getters. No new direct process.env reads in routes.
6) Keep vite guards that exclude /api/* from the catch-all. Do not remove or weaken them.
7) Backward compatibility: do not break existing endpoints. If you add versions, use /api/v2/* and keep v1 working.
8) Migrations must be idempotent (IF NOT EXISTS) and reversible when possible.
9) Ship in vertical slices: migration → service → endpoints → UI → tests → smoke test → log summary.
10) If anything conflicts, adapt to intent without breaking this section.

2) Do-Not-Touch / Must-Keep List

Do-Not-Touch
- server/vite.ts: keep /api/* guards in both dev and prod paths.
- server/services/env.ts: single source of truth for config.
- /api/discord/interactions: must continue to use express.raw and signature verification.
- Existing migrations: do not modify historical files; add new numbered SQL migrations.

Must-Keep
- Supabase connection string with sslmode=require.
- Cache headers: /api/* responses should include 'Cache-Control: no-store'.
- Error envelope: { error: { code, message } } for failures.


⸻

3) Definition of Done (per issue / feature)

Definition of Done
- ✅ New SQL migration added under migrations/ with IF NOT EXISTS guards.
- ✅ Service layer implemented in server/services/*.ts with types.
- ✅ Routes added under /api/*; JSON only; input validated; 4xx/5xx use error envelope.
- ✅ Unit or contract test (server/tests/*) for service + one happy-path route.
- ✅ Smoke tests pass (see §Smoke Tests).
- ✅ Docs updated (replit.md + OPENAPI chunk updated).
- ✅ Logs show JSON result previews and timing for new endpoints.

4) Minimal OpenAPI spec (so Agent keeps routes consistent)

# openapi.yaml (append or create if missing)
openapi: 3.0.3
info: { title: THE COMMISH API, version: 0.1.0 }
servers: [{ url: https://thecommish.replit.app }]
paths:
  /api/leagues/{leagueId}:
    get:
      parameters: [{ name: leagueId, in: path, required: true, schema: { type: string, format: uuid } }]
      responses: { "200": { description: OK } }
    patch:
      parameters: [{ name: leagueId, in: path, required: true, schema: { type: string, format: uuid } }]
      requestBody: { required: true, content: { application/json: { schema: { type: object } } } }
      responses: { "200": { description: OK } }
  /api/polls:
    post:
      requestBody: { required: true, content: { application/json: { schema: { type: object } } } }
      responses: { "200": { description: OK } }
  /api/terminal/execute:
    post:
      requestBody: { required: true, content: { application/json: { schema: { type: object, properties: { leagueId: { type: string }, command: { type: string } }, required: [leagueId, command] } } } }
      responses: { "200": { description: OK } }

5) Security & Rate-Limit Requirements

Security Requirements
- Admin endpoints must require X-Admin-Key header == env.app.adminKey.
- Commissioner-only routes must validate Discord role membership via stored mapping.
- Validate inputs with zod or a light schema; reject unknown fields.
- Respect Discord limits: 5 requests/second per route. Add jittered retry (exponential backoff) and embed length clamp (<=4096 chars).
- Return 429 for abusers; never block the whole app.


⸻

6) Observability & Logging

Observability
- Each request log: method, path, status, ms, and a 150-char JSON preview of response.
- On error: include error.code and a short message (no secrets).
- Add metrics counters: league_digests_posted, reminders_sent, rules_queries_answered.
- Write critical events to events table (install_completed, rules_indexed, digest_posted, dispute_frozen, peace_of_mind_updated).


⸻

7) Performance Budgets

Performance Budgets (p95 goals)
- /api/health < 2.5s total (DB < 400ms; LLM not on critical path).
- Any GET < 800ms from warm cache; POST < 1.5s unless LLM is required.
- Indexing runs async; endpoint returns quickly with { accepted: true } and event emitted.


⸻

8) Data & Migrations Checklist (Supabase)

Migrations Checklist
- Include BEGIN/COMMIT.
- Use IF NOT EXISTS for tables, types, indexes, extensions.
- Default to schema public unless "extensions" schema is used for extensions.
- After migration: run SELECT on pg_extension and critical tables; emit migration_applied event.

Retention / PII
- Do not store message bodies from Discord long-term. Keep messageId, channelId, authorId, summary, toxicity score, timestamp.
- Allow per-league purge of sentiment data.


⸻

9) Feature Flags (so new stuff can be dark-launched)

Feature Flags
- Add leagues.feature_flags JSONB if missing (or keep existing).
- Flags: autoMeme, vibesMonitor, tradeFairness, blindTools, creativeTrashTalk, deepStats.
- All new behavior must check flag first. Default OFF for experimental features.


⸻

10) QA / Smoke Tests (Agent should run these after each chunk)

# qa-smoke.sh (Agent: create this and run on each deploy)
set -e
B=https://thecommish.replit.app
echo "1) Health"; curl -s -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' $B/api/health | jq '.status,.services'
echo "2) Events"; curl -s $B/api/events?limit=3 | jq '.[].type' | head -3
echo "3) League (bad id -> JSON error)"; curl -s $B/api/leagues/not-a-uuid | jq '.error.code'
echo "4) v2 League (cache bypass)"; curl -s $B/api/v2/leagues/not-a-uuid | jq '.error.code'
echo "5) Poll (invalid -> JSON error)"; curl -s -X POST $B/api/polls -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{}' | jq '.error.code'
echo "6) Terminal dry run"; curl -s -X POST $B/api/terminal/execute -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H "X-Admin-Key: $ADMIN_KEY" -d '{"leagueId":"not-a-uuid","command":"league status"}' | jq '.error.code'


⸻

11) Coding Standards (so the Agent keeps the repo consistent)

Coding Standards
- TypeScript strict mode on; no any unless isolated with TODO and reason.
- Use small functions; one responsibility per function.
- No new default exports; named exports only.
- Lint + format: run eslint --fix and prettier on touched files.
- Test names: should <do something> style; use vitest/jest if present.
- Commit messages: feat:, fix:, chore:, refactor:, docs:, test:, perf:


⸻

12) Rollout / Backout

Rollout
- New features behind flags; leave flags OFF by default unless specified.
- Add dashboard switches only after backend verified.

Backout
- If migration fails, do not partially apply. Abort and report.
- Keep previous release runnable; do not remove working v1 routes.

Cache / CDN
- Send 'Cache-Control: no-store' for all /api/*.
- For routes previously cached as HTML, keep /api/v2/* aliases until CDN TTLs are certainly expired.


⸻

13) “Board of 12” nudges (short advisory to keep Agent aligned)

Advisory Nudges (keep in mind)
- Commissioner pain (r/ffcommish): reminders, fairness, drama. Optimize for peace-of-mind, not “more features.”
- Player engagement (r/fantasyfootball): highlights > walls of text. Keep digests punchy; add emojis/tone based on selected personality.
- Platform parity: build on Sleeper first; abstract adapters for ESPN/Yahoo later.
- Privacy: sentiment is useful but sensitive. Aggregate; avoid storing raw drama. Provide opt-out.
- Reliability beats cleverness: fail softly, retry intelligently, log everything.


⸻

14) Final action block for the Agent (what to do right now)

Execution Order (do in this session)
1) Ensure vite /api/* guards and server order remain intact (no regressions).
2) Add/verify migrations for Phase 1 (owner mapping table if missing, reminders config, events types), idempotent.
3) Implement service + endpoints for:
   - Owner Mapping (GET/POST/PATCH /api/leagues/:id/owners)
   - Reminder Packs (GET/PUT /api/leagues/:id/reminders)
4) Add Dashboard UI: Owner Mapper (drag + drop), Reminders toggles (lineup, waivers, trade deadline, bye weeks), Do-Not-Disturb window.
5) Polish Rules Q&A responses: include citation snippet + section number + “View rule” link (no schema changes — reuse docs/embeddings).
6) Add basic tests + run §Smoke Tests; paste outputs into a new QA_RESULTS.md.
7) Post a concise changelog to replit.md: what changed, endpoints, feature flags touched, how to use.

If a step fails, STOP, print the failing command and the observed error JSON, and propose the minimal diff to fix. Do not proceed until smoke tests pass.

	•	CODEOWNERS: * @goodguyai.
	•	CONTRIBUTING.md: short “how we ship vertical slices.”
