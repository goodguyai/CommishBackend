Perfect — and yes, those two earlier messages (the “🧠 How to Send It Into Planning Mode” + the “🧭 The Commish — Pre-Phase-5 Hygiene & Reliability Blueprint”) are already incorporated into what we’re doing next.
They form the foundation of the process — Replit just happened to jump ahead a little by completing Phases 1-4 and pre-building most of Phase 5’s observability layer.

So here’s how to merge everything cleanly, fix the process, and keep Replit on-track.

⸻

🧩 What’s Happened So Far
	•	The “🧠 How to Send It Into Planning Mode” message → gave Replit its orchestration logic (so it doesn’t rewrite or duplicate). ✅ Keep it.
	•	The “🧭 Pre-Phase-5 Hygiene Blueprint” message → told Replit exactly what to harden and test in the live logs. ✅ Also keep it.
	•	Replit’s last response shows:
✅ Observability, scheduler, and job ledger are already implemented.
❌ Remaining issues: Snowflake coercion, idempotency gaps, error envelope normalization, dashboard IA cleanup.

Therefore, we don’t need to resend the old pre-Phase-5 blueprint, but we do need to run one more short corrective work order that bridges those two blueprints and aligns with Replit’s new reality.

🧭 Message to Send to Replit (NEXT STEP)

Copy and paste everything below directly into Planning Mode:

⸻


🧭 Context Update for Replit Agent
This supersedes and merges the Pre-Phase-5 Hygiene Blueprint and the Idempotency & Reliability Hardening Plan.
You’ve already completed Phases 1-4 (observability, scheduler, jobs) and partially delivered Phase 5 features.
Now finalize all hygiene and reliability gaps before moving on.

🎯 OBJECTIVE
Unify the environment by finishing the Pre-Phase-5 hygiene tasks that remain open (log cleanup, cron detail, cleanup doctor) and executing the new Phase 5 reliability tasks (snowflake fixes, idempotency keys, error envelopes, dashboard IA cleanup).  
Do not refactor or delete beyond this scope.

## PHASE 5 CONSOLIDATED WORK ORDER

### Tier 1 (Critical Reliability)
1. **Discord Snowflake String Safety**
   - Audit and fix numeric coercions:  
     `rg -n "(Number\(.*Id|parseInt.*Id|\+.*Id)" server client | grep -i "guild\|channel\|user"`
   - All IDs must remain strings; throw 400 on invalid formats.

2. **Idempotency Keys**
   - Extend `bot_activity.key` usage for:
     - Announcements → `announce:${guildId}:${channelId}:${sha256(body)}`
     - Constitution drafts → hash of Sleeper settings (snapshot hash column in leagues)
   - Skip duplicates if hash exists within 24 h. Log “Skipped duplicate due to idempotency key.”

3. **Error Envelope Normalization**
   - All API errors return uniform JSON:
     ```json
     { "ok": false, "code": "<CODE>", "message": "<human-readable>" }
     ```
   - Audit: `rg -n "res\.status\(\d+\)\.json\(" server | head -50`
   - Apply consistently to /api/v2 and /api/v3.

---

### Tier 2 (Hygiene Completion)
4. **Log Sanitation**
   - Deduplicate “✅ Environment validation passed.”  
   - Prefix logs: [Startup], [Scheduler], [Doctor].

5. **Doctor Enhancements**
   - Add `/api/doctor/cron/detail` with job queue lengths, next run, last run, last error.  
   - Add `/api/doctor/cleanup?dry=true` (returns JSON preview of pending cleanup).  

6. **Content Poster Seeding**
   - Ensure `leagues.jobs.contentPoster.enabled=true`.  
   - Seed defaults for existing leagues if missing.

7. **Dashboard IA Cleanup**
   - Simplify Dashboard → only:
       • Today  
       • This Week  
       • System Health  
   - Move advanced tiles to Switchboard or Constitution tabs.

---

### Tier 3 (Polish / Validation)
8. **Rate Limit Announcements**
   - Add per-channel cooldown (30 s default).  
   - Return HTTP 429 + `{ok:false,code:"COOLDOWN"}` when triggered.

9. **Schema Validation**
   - Ensure `jobs_run` exists and timestamps are `timestamptz UTC`.
   - Confirm `settings_hash` column in leagues.

## 📊 VERIFICATION SCRIPT

curl -sS https://thecommish.replit.app/api/doctor/status | jq
curl -sS https://thecommish.replit.app/api/doctor/cron/detail | jq
curl -sS https://thecommish.replit.app/api/doctor/cleanup?dry=true | jq

Expected: All services ok:true and job counts > 0.  
Logs must show no duplicate announcements and consistent error envelopes.

---

✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA
- No numeric Discord IDs left in repo  
- Uniform error responses  
- Announcements + drafts idempotent  
- Rate limit works (429 on spam)  
- Dashboard simplified  
- Doctor endpoints healthy  

Once you verify green checks for all items, report “Phase 5 Reliability Complete.”  
We will then proceed to Phase 6 (League Persona & Engagement Automation).


⸻

💡 Why This Merged Plan Works
	1.	It includes both earlier messages (your Pre-Phase-5 Blueprint and the planning-mode instructions) — so Replit still has context.
	2.	It aligns with the latest Replit log confirming Phases 1-4 and observability completion.
	3.	It ensures the last open reliability items (snowflakes, idempotency, envelopes, dashboard) are finished before any new product features.

Once you paste this to Replit Planning Mode and it runs, send me the returned log summary.
Then I’ll write the Phase 6 Work Order.md — a tight, production-ready brief to start adding League Persona Automation (the personality modules, reactions, and league engagement layer).
