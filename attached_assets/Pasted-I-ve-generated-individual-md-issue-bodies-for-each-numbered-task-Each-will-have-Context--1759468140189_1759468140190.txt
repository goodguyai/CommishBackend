issue-0.1.md — Migration baseline

# Migrations: add Phase-1/2 base tables and columns

## Context
To support Phase 1 (owner mapping, reminders, league settings) and Phase 2 (disputes/vibes), we need new schema elements in Supabase.

## User Story
As a developer  
I want a single idempotent migration  
So that the database always reflects the schema needed for the Commish features.

## Acceptance
- Migration file: `migrations/0005_co_commish.sql`
- Adds/ensures:
  - `leagues.feature_flags JSONB default '{}'`
  - `leagues.personality TEXT default 'neutral'`
  - `members` (discord ↔ sleeper mapping, unique constraints)
  - `reminders` (type, cron, timezone, enabled)
  - `polls` + `votes`
  - `sentiment_logs`
  - `trade_insights`
  - `pgvector` + `pgcrypto` extensions
- Idempotent: safe to run multiple times
- Applies cleanly in Supabase; visible in dashboard

## Dependencies
None (foundation task).

issue-0.2.md — API guardrails

# Infra: guarantee `/api/*` never serves HTML

## Context
CDN/Vite middleware previously intercepted `/api/*` routes, returning HTML instead of JSON. This undermined reliability.

I want `/api/*` to always return structured JSON responses  
So that bot features and dashboard UIs never break.

## Acceptance
- `vite.ts` guard for `/api/*`
- `server/index.ts` mounts API routes before vite middleware
- JSON 404 handler for unmatched `/api/*`
- Temporary `/api/v2/*` aliases created
- `curl` tests confirm JSON on `/api/v2/leagues/:id` and `/api/v2/polls`

## Dependencies
Migration baseline (0.1) for full test coverage.
