# THE COMMISH - E2E Test Triage Report
**Date:** October 3, 2025  
**Sprint:** Polish & Reliability - Automated UX Testing  
**Status:** ⚠️ **BLOCKED - Cache/Deployment Issue**

---

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive Playwright e2e test suite has been developed with 10 tests covering critical user flows. All test code and component fixes are complete, but tests are currently failing due to **production site serving stale/cached frontend assets**. The data-testid attributes and route fixes exist in source code but are not present in the deployed DOM.

**Root Cause:** Production URL (https://thecommish.replit.app) is serving cached HTML that predates the test attribute additions.

## Test Suite Overview

| Test # | Test Name | Status | Issue Type |
|--------|-----------|--------|------------|
| 01 | Home page loads and CTAs exist | ⚠️ BLOCKED | Cache - elements not in DOM |
| 02 | Demo activation flow (no auth required) | ⚠️ BLOCKED | Cache - elements not in DOM |
| 03 | Setup Wizard visible and resumable | ⚠️ BLOCKED | Cache - elements not in DOM |
| 04 | API sanity: health/events/leagues endpoints return JSON | ✅ PASSING | N/A |
| 05 | Discord channels listing (if guildId provided) | ⏭️ SKIPPED | No guildId in test env |
| 06 | Owners mapping UI + API | ⚠️ BLOCKED | Cache - elements not in DOM |
| 07 | Reminders create/list (custom) | ⏭️ SKIPPED | No leagueId in test env |
| 08 | Polls create/list | ⏭️ SKIPPED | No leagueId in test env |
| 09 | RAG indexing/search | ⏭️ SKIPPED | No leagueId in test env |
| 10 | Digest preview generation | ⏭️ SKIPPED | No leagueId in test env |

**Total:** 1 Passing • 3 Blocked • 6 Skipped (conditional)

## Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. Missing data-testid Attributes ✅ FIXED

**Issue:** UI components lacked test identifiers required for Playwright selectors.

**Components Fixed:**
- `client/src/components/HomeCTAs.tsx` - Added `cta-try-demo` and `cta-activate-beta`
- `client/src/components/ModeBadge.tsx` - Added `badge-mode-demo`
- `client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` - Added `dashboard-root`
- `client/src/pages/Onboarding.tsx` - Added `setup-step-discord`, `setup-step-sleeper`, `setup-step-rules`

**Verification:** ✅ Confirmed in source code via grep
```bash
grep -r 'data-testid="cta-try-demo"' client/src/
# client/src/components/HomeCTAs.tsx:82:            data-testid="cta-try-demo"
```

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - Attributes exist in source, awaiting deployment

---

### 2. Wrong Route in Tests ✅ FIXED

**Issue:** Test 06 navigated to `/dashboard` but actual route is `/app`.

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// BEFORE:
await page.goto(`${APP}/dashboard`, { waitUntil: 'networkidle' });

// AFTER:
await page.goto(`${APP}/app`, { waitUntil: 'networkidle' });
```

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - Test code updated

---

### 3. API Endpoint Mismatch ✅ FIXED

**Issue:** Test 07 expected `/api/v2/reminders` but backend implements `/api/leagues/:leagueId/reminders`.

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// BEFORE:
POST /api/v2/reminders with { leagueId, message, scheduledFor }
GET /api/v2/reminders?leagueId=${id}

// AFTER:
POST /api/leagues/${KNOWN.leagueId}/reminders with { message, scheduledFor }
GET /api/leagues/${KNOWN.leagueId}/reminders
```

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - Test code aligned with backend API structure

---

### 4. Insufficient Wait Strategies ✅ FIXED

**Issue:** Tests used `domcontentloaded` which doesn't wait for React hydration.

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed `waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded'` → `waitUntil: 'networkidle'`
- Added explicit `waitForSelector('[data-testid="..."]', { timeout: 10000 })` before assertions
- Added `waitForURL` after navigation actions

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - Improved reliability in test code

---

## Critical Blocker: Cache/Deployment Issue ⚠️

**Problem:** Production URL serves stale HTML

**Evidence:**
```bash
# Diagnostic Test Results
Home page HTML length: 20796 bytes
Demo button exists: false
Beta button exists: false
Dashboard root exists: false
Setup Discord step exists: false
```

**Attempted Fixes:**
1. ✅ Workflow restart via `restart_workflow` - Did not clear cache
2. ✅ Verified Vite HMR logs show components hot-reloaded
3. ✅ Confirmed source files contain data-testid attributes

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Dev server (6af4d371-c976-42de-b33d-bd2947b222c0-00-2brktdylk8a4w.kirk.replit.dev) has latest code
- Production URL (thecommish.replit.app) serves through CDN/proxy with stale cache
- Workflow restart rebuilds backend but doesn't invalidate frontend proxy cache

---

## Recommended Actions

### Option 1: Clear Frontend Cache (Recommended)
1. Trigger production deployment to invalidate CDN cache
2. Or manually clear Replit proxy cache for thecommish.replit.app
3. Re-run diagnostic test to verify data-testid attributes in DOM
4. Execute full e2e test suite

### Option 2: Test Against Dev Server (Temporary)
1. Update `APP_BASE_URL` in tests to use dev server subdomain
2. Run tests against live dev environment
3. Re-deploy to production once cache issue resolved

### Option 3: Add Cache-Busting (Long-term)
1. Configure Vite to generate content-hashed filenames
2. Add cache control headers to prevent stale asset serving
3. Implement versioning in HTML meta tags

## Next Steps

**Immediate (Unblocks Testing):**
1. [ ] Investigate Replit deployment cache settings
2. [ ] Clear production cache or trigger fresh deployment
3. [ ] Verify data-testid attributes present in production DOM
4. [ ] Re-run all tests and document results

**Post-Unblock (Complete Sprint):**
1. [ ] Set up demo league for conditional tests (05, 07-10)
2. [ ] Add reminders system UI (if not complete)
3. [ ] Add RAG polish UI (if not complete)
4. [ ] Add engagement features UI (polls, memes) if not complete
5. [ ] Final QA verification pass
6. [ ] Update project documentation
