# THE COMMISH - Fantasy Football Discord Bot

## Overview

THE COMMISH is a Discord bot designed for fantasy football leagues, primarily integrated with the Sleeper platform. The application serves as an AI-powered commissioner assistant that helps league members with rule inquiries, deadline tracking, and automated digest generation. Built as a full-stack web application with a React frontend for management and a Node.js backend that handles Discord interactions, the system uses advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) capabilities powered by DeepSeek LLM to provide intelligent responses to league constitution questions.

  - Hardened with guards for missing league and user validation

### Reminder System (October 1, 2025)
- **Scheduler Methods**: Added timezone-aware reminder scheduling with multi-interval support (24h, 1h before deadlines)
- **Event Handler**: `reminder_due` event sends Discord embeds with per-league feature flag checks
- **Feature Toggles**: Per-league reminders for lineup lock, waiver, trade deadline (default enabled)
- **Automatic Scheduling**: Integrated with Sleeper sync - automatically schedules reminders after data sync
- **Timezone Support**: All reminders respect league.timezone setting
- **Smart Logic**: Skips reminders less than 1h away, schedules 24h reminder only if deadline is 24+ hours away

### Rules Indexing Enhancements (October 1, 2025)
- **Setup Wizard Constitution Step**: Added optional constitution upload step between Sleeper connection and final activation
- **Paste Text Interface**: Users can paste league constitution text directly into a textarea during onboarding
- **Automatic Indexing**: Constitution text is automatically parsed and indexed using existing RAG system with SHA-256 caching
- **Version Tracking**: Documents are versioned (starting at "1.0.0") for tracking changes over time
- **Optional Flow**: Users can skip constitution upload and add it later from dashboard
- **Character Counter**: Real-time character count display for pasted text
- **Smart Parsing**: System handles both structured JSON and plain text constitutions with automatic section detection

### RAG Semantic Search Improvements (October 1, 2025)
- **Passage-Scoped Extraction**: New algorithm extracts most relevant passages from rules based on query terms
  - Sentence-level scoring matching query terms
  - Context inclusion (surrounding sentences for better understanding)
  - Smart passage truncation (max 300 chars per passage)
  - Multiple passage support (up to 2 per rule by default)
- **Enhanced EmbeddingResult Interface**: Added optional `passages` field containing extracted relevant text snippets
- **Configurable Top-K**: Already supported via `limit` parameter (default 5), now better documented
- **Confidence Threshold**: Already supported via `threshold` parameter (default 0.7), applied at vector search level
- **API Enhancement**: POST /api/rag/search/:leagueId now accepts `includePassages` parameter (defaults to true)
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: If no query terms match, returns beginning of rule text as fallback passage

### Quick Polls Feature (October 1, 2025)
- **Database Schema**: polls table with leagueId, question, options (JSONB), discordMessageId, createdBy, expiresAt
- **API Endpoints**: 
  - GET /api/polls/:leagueId - Retrieve all polls for a league
  - POST /api/polls - Create poll and post to Discord with emoji reactions
- **Discord Integration**: Posts embeds with numbered emoji reactions (1Ô∏è‚É£-üîü) for voting
- **Dashboard UI**: QuickPollForm component with dynamic options (2-10), validation, toast notifications
- **Error Handling**: Graceful Discord posting failures, comprehensive validation

### Auto-Meme Feature (October 1, 2025)
- **Feature Toggle**: leagues.featureFlags.autoMeme (default false)
- **Blowout Detection**: Analyzes matchup scores during digest generation
- **Threshold**: Score difference ‚â• 40 points triggers meme posting
- **Meme Library**: Randomized humorous messages about blowout games
- **Integration**: Runs after weekly digest, posts to Discord channel
- **Safety**: Non-fatal errors (meme failures don't affect digest)
- **Event Logging**: Tracks auto_meme_posted events with score differences

### Known Limitations
- Owner mapping endpoints require schema extension (sleeperOwnerId, sleeperTeamName fields on members table)
- Scheduler handlers lack retry logic for transient failures (acceptable for MVP)
- Admin key authentication via browser prompt (acceptable for internal dev tools)
- **Sleeper Deadline Population**: Sleeper API provides trade_deadline as week numbers; converting to precise timestamps requires NFL schedule mapping (enhancement opportunity for full waiver/trade deadline automation)
- **Poll Results**: No vote counting or results retrieval (future enhancement)
- **Poll Expiry**: No automatic cleanup for expired polls (future enhancement)

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The client uses React with TypeScript, built on Vite for development and bundling. The UI is constructed with shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives, styled with Tailwind CSS using a dark theme by default. State management is handled through TanStack Query (React Query) for server state and local React state for UI interactions. The application uses Wouter for client-side routing and implements a responsive design with mobile-first considerations.

### Backend Architecture
The server runs on Node.js with Express, utilizing TypeScript throughout. The architecture follows a modular service-oriented pattern with clear separation of concerns:

- **API Layer**: Express routes handle HTTP requests, Discord OAuth2 flows, and webhook interactions
- **Service Layer**: Distinct services for Discord interactions, Sleeper API integration, DeepSeek LLM communication, and RAG functionality
- **Storage Layer**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL (Supabase) for data persistence
- **Event System**: Custom EventBus for handling asynchronous operations and system events
- **Scheduler**: Node-cron based job scheduling for digest generation and data synchronization

### Database Design
Uses PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM, featuring:
- **Core entities**: accounts, leagues, members, documents, rules, facts, deadlines, events
- **Vector storage**: pgvector extension for embedding-based similarity search
- **Audit trail**: Comprehensive event logging with request tracking and latency metrics
- **Feature flags**: Per-league configuration for enabling/disabling bot features

### Discord Integration
Implements Discord's interaction model with:
- **Ed25519 signature verification** for secure webhook handling
- **Slash commands** with deferred responses to meet the 3-second response requirement
- **OAuth2 flow** with bot scope for server installation
- **Component interactions** including channel selection for bot configuration

### AI/RAG System
The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system processes league constitutions:
- **Document processing**: Stores original and normalized versions of league rules
- **Vector embeddings**: Uses OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 for semantic search
- **LLM integration**: DeepSeek chat completions API with function calling support
- **Similarity search**: Cosine similarity search through pgvector for relevant rule retrieval

### Sleeper Integration
Read-only integration with Sleeper's public API:
- **League data**: Fetches league information, rosters, and matchup data
- **Caching strategy**: In-memory caching with TTL to reduce API calls
- **Sync jobs**: Scheduled updates to keep data current

### Scheduling System
Built-in job scheduler using node-cron:
- **Weekly digests**: Configurable digest generation per league timezone
- **Data synchronization**: Regular Sleeper data updates
- **Event-driven**: Integrates with the EventBus for reactive operations
